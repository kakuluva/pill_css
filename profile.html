                        Mickey Mouse is a cartoon character created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at The Walt Disney Studios,
                        who serves as the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts,
                        large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable fictional characters. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p class="custom_p">
                        Created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, Mickey first appeared in the
                        short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons.
                        He went on to appear in over 130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia (1940).
                        Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated
                        for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the
                        first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

                    <p class="custom_p">
                        In the United States, protest votes are often made in order to indicate dissatisfaction with the slate of candidates presented
                        on a particular ballot or to highlight the inadequacies of a particular voting procedure. Since most states' electoral systems
                        do not provide for blank balloting or a choice of "None of the Above", most protest votes take the form of a clearly non-serious
                        candidate's name entered as a write-in vote. Mickey Mouse is often selected for this purpose. As an election supervisor
                        in Georgia observed, "If Mickey Mouse doesn’t get votes in our election, it’s a bad election." The earliest known mention
                        of Mickey Mouse as a write-in candidate dates back to the 1932 New York City mayoral elections.

                        Mickey Mouse's name has also been known to appear fraudulently on voter registration lists, such as in the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election.
